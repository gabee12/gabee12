- Hi, I’m @gabee12. I'm a 17 year old High-School student from Brazil. I've started to learn programming late november 2020. I speak Portuguese, English and German fluently. My programming languages of choice are C#/C++, Java, HTML and JS. I'm currently working on my first project, you can find out more about it below.
- I’m currently learning about and working on a bot for the VoIP program Discord. It's currently unnamed so if you have a name sugestion you can find out how to contact me below. I'll make sure to credit you for it.
- You can contact me via e-mail @ gabe_e12@outlook.com or via Discord Gabe#0843, as I don't really use any other social media platforms
